## Description

Bombs and Babies is a quirky one of a kind virtual reality game for the Meta Quest, where you fight to keep the trash organized, while making sure no bombs or babies get through to the furnace. Your objective is to survive for as long as possible, letting trash go in the wrong lane speeds up the belts, but letting a bomb or baby through is game over.

## Controls

Left stick: move
Right stick: pan view
Right inside trigger: grab
Right outside trigger: interact with UI

## Gameplay

Use the swap saber (left hand) to swap trash between belts. Bombs and babies can't be swapped, they must be carried with the right hand to their respective disposal sites.
